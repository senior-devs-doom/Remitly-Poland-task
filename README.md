# Remitly-Poland-task
coding task for internship at remitly

A task of getting exchange rates for GBP with HTTP request and calculating exchange for inputed values. Whole thing done in javascript without framework client side, I choose the simplest tool to get done with task quick but I'm aware its not scalable in any practical setting.

The user UI is simple, put number in either of the fields and exchange value will be calculated on keyup event, site will also automatically snip any illegal signs from the field using regex.
